# ET-derivation
To derive ET from satellite imagery using SEBAL model algorithm
John Jackson is here to put challenges confronting the derivation of ET using satellite images
ERDAS IMAGINE is the software to be used to write the algorithm
satellite images and weather data at the time of satellite over pass are also available
currently having challenges with writing of the equations in ERDAS
